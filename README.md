# AI Generative Portfolio – Prompt Engineering (Gemini)

This repository presents practical examples of prompt engineering and AI-assisted
multimedia content creation using **Gemini** as the primary generative AI platform.

The projects focus on designing structured prompts to generate short-form AI videos,
emphasizing scene-based storytelling, narrative flow, and visual consistency aligned
with business and brand requirements.

## Focus Areas
- Structured prompt design for AI video generation
- Scene-based thinking and sequencing
- Style, mood, and visual consistency control
- Iterative refinement of AI-generated video outputs
- Business-oriented use of generative AI

## Tools
- Gemini (AI video generation)
- Large Language Models for prompt design and refinement

## Disclaimer
All projects are personal or conceptual and are intended to showcase prompt engineering
skills and control over AI-generated video outputs rather than final commercial productions.
