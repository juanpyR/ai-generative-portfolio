## Project 01 – AI-generated explainer video (Gemini)

Goal:
Create a short, scene-based explainer video using generative AI.

Description:
This project uses structured prompting in Gemini to generate three short video clips
(8 seconds each) that together form a coherent narrative for a business automation explainer.

Deliverables:
- 3 AI-generated video clips (8 seconds each)
- A single structured prompt adapted per scene

Focus:
- Scene-based storytelling
- Visual consistency and style control
- Prompt-driven video generation

Tool:
- Gemini (AI video generation)

Notes:
Each video clip was generated using the same structured prompt,
modifying only the scene description to ensure visual and narrative consistency.
